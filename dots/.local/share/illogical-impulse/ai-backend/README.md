# (Deprecated) ii-ai-backend location

The AI backend has moved to:

- `~/.config/quickshell/ii/ai/`

Reason: backend is now started/managed by Quickshell (minimal system footprint).

This directory is kept only for compatibility/documentation in older installs.

See design doc: `sdata/design/ai-backend.md`
